            <h2>Extra Information on COVID-19</h2>
            <p>
                COVID-19 has been a global challenge, and there are many more aspects to understand. Beyond symptoms and prevention, it's essential to know about variants, treatments, and ongoing research to control the virus.
            </p>

            <h3>Variants of Concern</h3>
            <p>
                The virus has mutated over time, leading to new variants like Delta, Omicron, and others, which have different transmission rates and potential impacts on public health.
            </p>

            <h3>Treatments</h3>
            <p>
                Research into antiviral drugs, vaccines, and other therapeutic measures is continuously evolving. Vaccines like Pfizer, Moderna, and others have been widely distributed to reduce the severity of the disease.
            </p>

            <h3>Research</h3>
            <p>
                Ongoing studies are being conducted to improve vaccines, create new treatments, and better understand the long-term effects of the virus on individuals and healthcare systems.
            </p>

            <h3>Long COVID</h3>
            <p>
                Long COVID refers to symptoms that persist for weeks or months after the acute phase of the infection. These symptoms include fatigue, brain fog, difficulty breathing, and joint pain. Ongoing research is being conducted to better understand this condition and provide effective treatments.
            </p>

            <h3>Global Impact</h3>
            <p>
                The COVID-19 pandemic has impacted economies, healthcare systems, and societies worldwide. Global efforts, including vaccination drives and public health initiatives, have been made to slow down the spread of the virus. However, the pandemic has left a lasting impact on global trade, travel, and the mental health of individuals.
            </p>

            <h3>Mental Health Support</h3>
            <p>
                The pandemic has caused a significant rise in mental health issues such as anxiety, depression, and stress due to lockdowns, isolation, and uncertainty. Mental health support services, including counseling, online therapy, and mental health hotlines, are available to help those affected during these challenging times.
            </p>

            <h3>Vaccine Development</h3>
            <p>
                Vaccines have played a critical role in reducing the severity of COVID-19. New generations of vaccines are being developed to address different variants. It's important to stay informed about booster shots and vaccination schedules.
            </p>

            <h3>Public Health Measures</h3>
            <p>
                Governments have implemented various public health measures, including social distancing, mask mandates, and restrictions on gatherings, to control the spread of COVID-19. These measures may vary by region and evolve based on the current status of the virus.
